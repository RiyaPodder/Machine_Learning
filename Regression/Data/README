• SNPs.txt: Genotype data for 114 yeast strains and 1,260 SNPs. Each row corresponds to
the SNP genotypes for each of the 114 strains. The top two rows are the genotypes of
BY and RM strains, coded with all 1’s for BY and all 0’s for RM. The genotypes of the
other progeny strains have a mixture of 1’s from BY and 0’s from RM. SNPs are ordered
along the genome.
• expression.txt: Gene expression levels for 114 yeast strains and 3,684 genes.
• gene list.txt: The names of the 3,684 genes, for your reference.
• strain list.txt: The names of the 114 yeast strains, for your reference. Note that the top
two strains are BY and RM.
