Part of Assignment 1 of Machine Learning coursework at Carnegie Mellon University

Implementing linear, multivariate and ridge regression to analyze the genotype and gene expression data collected from two yeast strains, called BY and RM, and their 112 progenies.

The first two files below contain data to be analyzed and the last two files contain the meta-data:

• SNPs.txt: Genotype data for 114 yeast strains and 1,260 SNPs. Each row corresponds to
the SNP genotypes for each of the 114 strains. The top two rows are the genotypes of
BY and RM strains, coded with all 1’s for BY and all 0’s for RM. The genotypes of the
other progeny strains have a mixture of 1’s from BY and 0’s from RM. SNPs are ordered
along the genome.
• expression.txt: Gene expression levels for 114 yeast strains and 3,684 genes.
• gene list.txt: The names of the 3,684 genes, for your reference.
• strain list.txt: The names of the 114 yeast strains, for your reference. Note that the top
two strains are BY and RM.

Y and RM strains are known to have differences in the sequence of gene LEU2, which
corresponds to YCL018W. In this assignment, I perform regression analysis to identify
SNPs that affect LEU2 expression levels. (From the data above, you can verify that the
expression levels of LEU2 for all strains are given in column 395 of expression.txt.)
                                          
Note: In all of your analysis below, work with the expression and SNP data after mean-
centering so that you can work with the regression model without intercept.
