Part of Assignment 1 of Machine Learning coursework at Carnegie Mellon University

Implementing linear and ridge regression to analyze the genotype and gene expression data collected from two yeast strains, called BY and RM, and their 112 progenies.

Data folder contains relevant text files for the analysis.

BY and RM strains are known to have differences in the sequence of gene LEU2, which
corresponds to YCL018W. In this assignment, I perform regression analysis to identify
SNPs that affect LEU2 expression levels. (From the data above, you can verify that the
expression levels of LEU2 for all strains are given in column 395 of expression.txt.)
                                          
Note: In all of your analysis below, work with the expression and SNP data after mean-
centering so that you can work with the regression model without intercept.

Q_A_and_plots contains some particular questions, answers and plots related to the analysis. The plots were generated by the models.py code.
